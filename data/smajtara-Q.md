The deployCounterFactualWallet function has a potential issue where the SmartAccountCreated event is emitted before the BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler) function is called. This means that the state of the contract may be modified before the event is emitted, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.

To fix this issue, the BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler) function should be called before the SmartAccountCreated event is emitted. This will ensure that the event is emitted with the contract's initial state, rather than a state that has already been modified.

Here is an example of how the deployCounterFactualWallet function could be modified to fix this issue:

function deployCounterFactualWallet(address _owner, address _entryPoint, address _handler, uint _index) public returns(address proxy){
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_owner, address(uint160(_index))));
    bytes memory deploymentData = abi.encodePacked(type(Proxy).creationCode, uint(uint160(_defaultImpl)));
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
        proxy := create2(0x0, add(0x20, deploymentData), mload(deploymentData), salt)
    }
    require(address(proxy) != address(0), "Create2 call failed");
    BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler);
    // EOA + Version tracking
    emit SmartAccountCreated(proxy,_defaultImpl,_owner, VERSION, _index);
    isAccountExist[proxy] = true;
}

By calling the BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler) function before the SmartAccountCreated event is emitted, the state of the contract will be initialized before the event is triggered. This will help to ensure that the contract's behavior is consistent and predictable.
