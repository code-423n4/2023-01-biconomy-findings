1.    Remove the check
   ```
  require (owner == address(0), "Already Initialized");
   ```

 It's not necessary because the initializer modifier already prevents the function from being reinitialized.

2.   Remove the check 
       ```
       require(address(_entryPoint) == address(0), "Already initialized");
       ```

3.  Remove the check
     ```
     if (_handler != address(0))
     ```

Not necessary because input for address(0) has already been checked here

    require(_handler != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");

4.     uint256 requiredGas = startGas - gasleft(); should be unchecked 

       startGas will always be greater than gasleft(), no means of underflow.
