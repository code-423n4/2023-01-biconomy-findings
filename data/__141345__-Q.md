#### Unused/empty `receive()/fallback()` function

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. require(msg.sender == address(weth))). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds

```solidity
File: scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol
550:     receive() external payable {}
551: }

File: scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountNoAuth.sol
540:     receive() external payable {}
541: }

File: scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/samples/SimpleAccount.sol
41:     receive() external payable {}
```


#### return value not checked

When thereâ€™s a failure in the `_actualWallet.call(_data)`, the function will still proceed, potentially fund could be lost.

```solidity
File: scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/utils/GasEstimatorSmartAccount.sol
21:     (success, result) = _actualWallet.call(_data);
22:     gas = initialGas - gasleft();
```
Recommendation: Add return value checks.
