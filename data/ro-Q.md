1. The entry point address must be a contract, currently, there is no input validation. You can provide an EOA as the entry point. 

Instances:

- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L173


Recommendation: 
Check that the entry point has code. 


2. Update the EIP1271 implementation.

    Notice: The current EIP1271 is forked from gnosis safe. But the implementation is not eip1271 compliant, because gnosis safe implemented it 
   prior to the eip completeness. 
   There are a few changes to be made: 
     1: Update the magic value. The current magic value is: 

   ``` solidity
     bytes4 internal constant EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE = 0x20c13b0b;
    ``` 
    But the compliant magic value for the eip is: 0x1626ba7e

    2: Update the "isValidSignature" parameters. 
        In the validation signature, the interface for isValidSignature is: 

 
       function isValidSignature(bytes memory _data, bytes memory _signature) public view virtual returns (bytes4);
   
      But the correct compliant interface is: 

      function isValidSignature(
    bytes32 _hash, 
    bytes memory _signature)
    public
    view 
    returns (bytes4 magicValue);


3. Incorrect "validateUserOp" implementation. 
    If an invalid signature is provided in "validateUserOp", we should return an invalid message instead of reverting.
   As stated from the eip: "SHOULD return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED (and not revert) on signature mismatch."

  The current implementation just reverts if the signatures don't belong to the owner: 
   https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L506

  ```solidity
        require(owner == hash.recover(userOp.signature) || tx.origin == address(0), "account: wrong signature");
```
   Recommendation: Be compliant with the EIP, here is an example from the Infinitsm team: 
  https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L107
```solidity
 function _validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash, address)
    internal override virtual returns (uint256 sigTimeRange) {
        bytes32 hash = userOpHash.toEthSignedMessageHash();
        if (owner != hash.recover(userOp.signature))
            return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED;
        return 0;
    }
```
