1. The entry point address must be a contract, currently, there is no input validation. You can provide an EOA as the entry point.

Recommendation: 
Check that the entry point has code. 


2. Update the EIP1271 implementation.

    Notice: The current EIP1271 is forked from gnosis safe. But the implementation is not eip1271 compliant, because gnosis safe implemented it 
   prior to the eip completeness. 
   There are a few changes to be made: 
     1: Update the magic value. The current magic value is: 

   ``` solidity
     bytes4 internal constant EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE = 0x20c13b0b;
    ``` 
    But the compliant magic value for the eip is: 0x1626ba7e

    2: Update the "isValidSignature" parameters. 
        In the validation signature, the interface for isValidSignature is: 

 
       function isValidSignature(bytes memory _data, bytes memory _signature) public view virtual returns (bytes4);
   
      But the correct compliant interface is: 

      function isValidSignature(
    bytes32 _hash, 
    bytes memory _signature)
    public
    view 
    returns (bytes4 magicValue);
