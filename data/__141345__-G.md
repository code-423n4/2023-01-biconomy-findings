#### Update value order can be adjusted to simplify the code and save gas

For example, to update the `val` variable with `newVal`, the current way is as following:

```solidity
    uint oldVal = val;
    val = newVal;
    emit update(oldVal, newVal);
```

If the execution order is adjusted, some operations can be saved (memory space allocation, variable assignment), reducing both the deployment and run time gas cost.

```solidity
    emit update(val, newVal);
    val = newVal;
```

The operation saved: 1 sload, 1 memory allocation, 1 mstore.

The demo of the gas comparison can be seen [here](https://github.com/141345/gas_demo/blob/main/oldnew.sol).


There are multiple places can use this trick for optimization, since the updates of parameters are widely and frequently used, the optimization can be beneficial.

```solidity 
File: scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountNoAuth.sol
109:     function setOwner(address _newOwner) external mixedAuth {
110:         require(_newOwner != address(0), "Smart Account:: new Signatory address cannot be zero");
111:         address oldOwner = owner;
112:         owner = _newOwner;
113:         emit EOAChanged(address(this), oldOwner, _newOwner);
114:     }
```

The above can be changed to:
```solidity
     function setOwner(address _newOwner) external mixedAuth {
         require(_newOwner != address(0), "Smart Account:: Signatory address cannot be zero");
         emit EOAChanged(address(this), owner, _newOwner);
         owner = _newOwner;
     }
```
