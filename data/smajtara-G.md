The isAccountExist mapping is declared at the beginning of the contract and is never used in any function. This mapping serves no purpose and can be removed to reduce the contract's storage size and gas usage.

To remove the mapping, simply delete the following line of code:

mapping (address => bool) public isAccountExist;

This change will have no impact on the contract's behavior, as the mapping is never accessed or modified. However, it will reduce the contract's storage size and gas usage, which can be beneficial in cases where storage space or gas is limited.

It is generally a good practice to remove unnecessary code or variables from contracts to minimize their size and resource usage. In this case, removing the unused isAccountExist mapping is a simple and safe way to optimize the contract.
