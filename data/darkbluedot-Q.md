1 - The function call in the modifier is not necessary, we can also use this in the modifier and achieve the same results.  The use of the modifier is suggested as that makes the code clean and readable. Also, it saves some gas on the way as well. So, instead of writing the modifier the way it's written, it can also be written as  
```
 modifier onlyOwner(){
        require(msg.sender == address(this) || owner == msg.sender  , "Only Owner");
        _;
    }
```
Also, you can see that here the msg.sender == address(this) is written first, and then the other check is written. This is because the probability that the calling node is not a contract and just an EOA is higher so, the if statement will short-circuit and will not check the other statement. This will in turn save some gas costs in execution. 

2 - The function requireFromEntryPointOrOwner is used as a guard check in many functions. It's suggested to use a modifier to add guard checks rather than calling this function everywhere.
