## Duplicated check: _handler != address(0)
`File: contracts/SmartAccount.sol`
`Line: 174`

    function init(address _owner, address _entryPointAddress, address _handler) public override initializer {     
      require(owner == address(0), "Already initialized");      
      require(address(_entryPoint) == address(0), "Already initialized");
      require(_owner != address(0),"Invalid owner"); 
      require(_entryPointAddress != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
      require(_handler != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
      owner = _owner;
      _entryPoint =  IEntryPoint(payable(_entryPointAddress));
      if (_handler != address(0)) internalSetFallbackHandler(_handler);
      setupModules(address(0), bytes(""));
    }

the  `if (_handler != address(0))` not needed because `require(_handler != address(0))` checks that `_handler` is not a zero address
