### [LOW-01]Change the order of emit

It should be build the IEntryPoint first, then emit the event. This is to prevent from issues when building IEntryPoint failed.

**Proof Of Concept**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L129-L130

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Change it to:

```
entryPoint = IEntryPoint(payable(_newEntryPoint));
emit EntryPointChanged(address(_entryPoint), _newEntryPoint);
```


### [LOW-02]Avoid to create a sender with address 0 
In createSender function, if we finally failed to create a sender, we return an address 0. And we validate outside when invoking this function, this behaviour is very dangerous and doesn't follow "minimum exposure" principle. We'd better to handle this situation inside the function itself.


**Proof Of Concept**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/5df2e8f8c0fd3393b9ecdad9ef356955f07fbbdd/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/SenderCreator.sol#L25


**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Revert directly at the end of this function.



### [LOW-03] Initilize() function can be called by anybody
Anyone has the access of ```init``` function and can set the owner and entryPointAddress.

initializer doesn't cover the ownership issue. It can only make sure the function is only initialized once. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol

**Proof Of Concept**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L166-L176


**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Add the modifier of ```mixedAuth```

### [LOW-04] Lack the validation that the divisor should not be 0.

If b is 0, the transaction will be reverted because there is no validation that b != 0.

As it is a very basic function in math.sol, so we need to add a message to tell the customers why the transaction being reverted. 
**Proof Of Concept**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/libs/Math.sol#L45-L47

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Add  ```require(b!=0, "divisor should not be 0");```

### [NC-01]Solidity versions should be consistent

Most of solidity versions in the files are ```pragma solidity ^0.8.12;```Other files are ```pragma solidity 0.8.12```, it's better to make them consisten.

**Proof Of Concept**

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.12;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/EntryPoint.sol

```
pragma solidity 0.8.12;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountFactory.sol

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Make the versions consistent

### [NC-02]Change some functions into modifiers

There are some functions which only do the validations. They are better to be modifier instead of functions

**Proof Of Concept**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountNoAuth.sol#L484

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/BasePaymaster.sol#L104

 https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L98

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L52

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/base/ModuleManager.sol#L105

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Change them into modifiers



It should be build the IEntryPoint first, then emit the event.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L129-L130


### [NC-03]Some enum values are never used

In the enum Rounding, the values of Up and Zero are never used. So this could be changed into a flag, like "isUp", this is already enough because the default of our calculation is to round down. There is no need to keep a value of ```down```.

**Proof Of Concept**
```
​    enum Rounding {

​        Down, // Toward negative infinity

​        Up, // Toward infinity

​        Zero // Toward zero

​    }
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/libs/Math.sol#L10-L14

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Making these enums as one boolean flag is already enough.


### [NC-04]Open TODOs

An open TODO is present. It is recommended to avoid open TODOs as they may indicate programming errors that still need to be fixed.

**Proof Of Concept**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/5df2e8f8c0fd3393b9ecdad9ef356955f07fbbdd/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/EntryPoint.sol#L255

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/5df2e8f8c0fd3393b9ecdad9ef356955f07fbbdd/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountNoAuth.sol#L44

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Resolve these TODOs

### [NC-05]Add the validation of start address  
In ```getModulesPaginated``` function, We didn't validate if the start address is 0 or not. Also we didn't check if this address is in ```modules```. When start is 0x0, we treat it as a normal input and we'd better to add a require to validate ```start``` address.

**Proof Of Concept**
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/5df2e8f8c0fd3393b9ecdad9ef356955f07fbbdd/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/base/ModuleManager.sol#L114

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Add a require to validate ```start``` address.

### [NC-06]Rename the function of getDeposit  

The name "getDeposit" is very confusing, it sounds like withdrawDeposit. Actually this function is to get the balance of deposit. So we can name it "getDepositBalance"

**Proof Of Concept**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/5df2e8f8c0fd3393b9ecdad9ef356955f07fbbdd/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/BasePaymaster.sol#L82

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**
Name it "getDepositBalance"
