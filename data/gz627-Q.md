### [NC-1] Emit event when receiving ETH

It's a good practice to emit an event whenever a state variable changes especially when receiving ETH. Function `SmartAccount.receive()` can emit an event to indicate receiving ETH, e.g. `emit ReceivedETH(from, to, amount)`. The event can be defined as:

The `receive function can be:`
```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol

    event ReceivedETH(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed amount);

    receive() external payable {
        emit ReceivedETH(msg.sender, address(this), msg.value);
    }

```

### [NC-2] Missing checks for `address(0)` in low-level call

[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L477-L484)

```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol

477:    function _call(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data) internal {
478:        (bool success, bytes memory result) = target.call{value : value}(data);
            if (!success) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
                }
            }
        }
```
In the above function, `target` is not verified. So, if there is no code at `target` address, the low-levell call `target.call()` will always return `true`. This has some implications:
1. Leading to permenant loss of ETH if `target` is mistakenly set to `address(0)`. In this case, it's a good practice to verify: `target != address(0)`;
2. If this function is to call a smart contract, i.e. `target` is supposed to ba an address of a smart contract, and if `target` is mistakenly set to a non-existing address (i.e. there is no code at `target` address), the low-level call `target.call()` will always return `true`, this breaks the function's logic. In this case, it is recommended to verify that the code size at `target` is larger than `0`.

### [NC-3] Redundant verification

*Instances (2)*

In `SmartAccount` contract, there are two function protected by `onlyOwner`. In the function body, they further restrict access by call `_requireFromEntryPointOrOwner()` on Line 461 and 466. Since `onlyOwner` has stricter restriction than `_requireFromEntryPointOrOwner()`. The latter can be omitted. 

[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L477-L484)
```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol

        function execute(address dest, uint value, bytes calldata func) external onlyOwner{
461:        _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner();  //@audit This line can be remove
            _call(dest, value, func);
        }

        function executeBatch(address[] calldata dest, bytes[] calldata func) external onlyOwner{
466:        _requireFromEntryPointOrOwner();  //@audit This line can be remove
            require(dest.length == func.length, "wrong array lengths");
            for (uint i = 0; i < dest.length;) {
                _call(dest[i], 0, func[i]);
                unchecked {
                    ++i;
                }
            }
        }
```
L461 and L466 can be removed.

### [NC-4] Versioning

[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L36)
```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol

36:    string public constant VERSION = "1.0.2"; // using AA 0.3.0
```

In Contract `SmartAccount`, `VERSION` is defined as a constant, which means the version number is fixed. It's alright if it is intended.
However, there is a `updateImplementation` function which upgrades functionality of the contract. It also emits an event: `emit ImplementationUpdated(address(this), VERSION, _implementation);`. If `VERSION` is a constant, it does not make much sense to include a constant in an event.

It is a good practice to change the `VERSION` information accordingly while upgrading. It might be a good choice to offer an option to change the `VERSION` number in `updateImplementation` function so that `VERSION` reflects current base wallet implementation status.

## Low Risk Issues

|     | Issue                                          | Instances |
| --- |:---------------------------------------------- |:---------:|
| L-1 | Unspecific compiler version pragma             |     1     |
| L-2 | `mixedAuth` modifier may have potential issues |     3     | 

### [L-1] Unspecific compiler version pragma
Don’t use `pragma solidity ^0.8.12` when you set the compiler version yourself. This makes it ambiguous to verifiers which version of solidity was used. Only use this pattern for library code where you are not the one to compile it. 

From security perspective there's always a trade-off between new code fixing known issues and potentially introducing new bugs in new releases. It is recommended to use a version that is released for a while instead of a nightly released version, i.e., to avoid from using `pragma solidity ^0.x.x;` or `pragma solidity >=0.8.12;`.
In this project, it is recommended to use version 0.8.17. So the recommended compiler version pragma is:
`pragma solidity 0.8.17;`

```solidity
File: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/BaseAccount.sol

2: pragma solidity ^0.8.12;
```

All other solidity files (except for Libraries) should make the same change.

### [L-2] `mixedAuth` modifier may have potential issues

Contract `SmartAccount` uses `mixedAuth` to protect privileged functions like `setOwner, updateImplementation, updateEntryPoint`. The modifier `mixedAuth` allows either the owner of the contract or the contract itself can access to these protected functions. However, in the current contract, there is no way for the contract itself to call these functions since there is no pre-coded code that can call these functions yet.
If there is no plan to implement new code to enable the contract itself to call these privileged functions, it is a good practice to change `mixedAuth` to `onlyOwner`. This is because `mixedAuth` relaxes the restriction. It may unintentionally introduce risks to allow access to privileged functions.
For example, if there is a need for a specific group of users to call an internal function `_call()` which makes low level call on provided address. The function may look like this:
```solidity
    function someFunction(address target, bytes memory calldata) external onlySpecificGroup {
        ...some code...
        _call(target, 0, calldata);
    }
```
**Note**: the above function is protected by `onlySpecificGroup`. Function `_call()` is an existing function in `SmartAccount` contract.

The above function will open doors for `onlySpecificGroup` to access to all privileged functions protected by `mixedAuth` since `target` can be set to the address of `SmartAccount` contract, and `calldata` can be encoded to call privileged functions. And the `msg.sender` received by the privileged function is the address of the calling contract, i.e. contract `SmartAccount`.

Suggestions for mitigation:
1. Change `mixedAuth` to `onlyOwner` if there is no necessary to implement extra code. Don't leave potential risks in the code.
2. Take extra cautions when implementing functional functionality that uses `mixedAuth`.
