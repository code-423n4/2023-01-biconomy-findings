## Findings

### 1- Use `unchecked` blocks to save gas :

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block.

There are 2 instances of this issue :

File: StakeManager.sol [Line 118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/StakeManager.sol#L118)
```
info.deposit = uint112(info.deposit - withdrawAmount);
```

The above operation cannot underflow due to the check :

[require(withdrawAmount <= info.deposit, "Withdraw amount too large");](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/aa-4337/core/StakeManager.sol#L117) 

It should be marked as `unchecked`. 

File: VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol [Line 58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L58)
```
paymasterIdBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
```

The above operation cannot underflow due to the check :

[require(amount <= currentBalance, "Insufficient amount to withdraw");](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L57) 

It should be marked as `unchecked`. 


### 2- Redundant check in `init` function should be removed :

In the `init` function from the `SmartAccount` the following check is redundant :

File: SmartAccount.sol [Line 174](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L174)
```
if (_handler != address(0)) internalSetFallbackHandler(_handler);
```

Because the check [line 171](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L171) ensures that we always have `_handler != address(0)` and so the `internalSetFallbackHandler` should be called immediatly and the if check should be removed to save gas.

### 3- `x += y/x -= y` costs more gas than `x = x + y/x = x - y` for state variables :

Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **113 gas** as explained [here](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8)

There are 3 instances of this issue:

```
paymasterIdBalances[paymasterId] += msg.value;
```

File: VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol [Line 58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L58)
```
paymasterIdBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
```

File: VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol [Line 128](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/paymasters/verifying/singleton/VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol#L128)
```
paymasterIdBalances[extractedPaymasterId] -= actualGasCost;
```

### 4- `require()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas :

Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 incurs an MSTORE which costs 3 gas.

There are 16 instances of this issue :

```
File: SmartAccount.sol

77      require(msg.sender == owner, "Smart Account:: Sender is not authorized");
110     require(_newOwner != address(0), "Smart Account:: new Signatory address cannot be zero");
128     require(_newEntryPoint != address(0), "Smart Account:: new entry point address cannot be zero");

File: SmartAccountFactory.sol

18      require(_baseImpl != address(0), "base wallet address can not be zero");

File: SmartAccountNoAuth.sol

77      require(msg.sender == owner, "Smart Account:: Sender is not authorized");
110     require(_newOwner != address(0), "Smart Account:: new Signatory address cannot be zero");
128     require(_newEntryPoint != address(0), "Smart Account:: new entry point address cannot be zero");
440     require(dest != address(0), "this action will burn your funds");

File: VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol

36      require(address(_entryPoint) != address(0), "VerifyingPaymaster: Entrypoint can not be zero address");
37      require(_verifyingSigner != address(0), "VerifyingPaymaster: signer of paymaster can not be zero address");
49      require(!Address.isContract(paymasterId), "Paymaster Id can not be smart contract address");
50      require(paymasterId != address(0), "Paymaster Id can not be zero address");
66      require(_newVerifyingSigner != address(0), "VerifyingPaymaster: new signer can not be zero address");
107     require(sigLength == 64 || sigLength == 65, "VerifyingPaymaster: invalid signature length in paymasterAndData");
108     require(verifyingSigner == hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(paymasterData.signature), "VerifyingPaymaster: wrong signature");
109     require(requiredPreFund <= paymasterIdBalances[paymasterData.paymasterId], "Insufficient balance for paymaster id");
```

### 5- Splitting `require()` statements that uses && saves gas :

There are 3 instances of this issue :

```
File: base/ModuleManager.sol

34      require(module != address(0) && module != SENTINEL_MODULES, "BSA101");
49      require(module != address(0) && module != SENTINEL_MODULES, "BSA101");
68      require(msg.sender != SENTINEL_MODULES && modules[msg.sender] != address(0), "BSA104");
```

### 6- `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead :

The `public` functions that are not called inside the contract should be declared `external` instead to save gas.

There are 17 instances of this issue:

```
File: SmartAccount.sol

155      function getNonce(uint256 batchId) public
166      function init(address _owner, address _entryPointAddress, address _handler) public  
389      function execTransaction(Transaction memory _tx, uint256 batchId, FeeRefund memory refundInfo, bytes memory signatures) public
518      function getDeposit() public 
525      function addDeposit() public 
536      function withdrawDepositTo(address payable withdrawAddress, uint256 amount) public 

File:  SmartAccountFactory.sol

105     function isModuleEnabled(address module) public view returns (bool) 

File: libs/MultiSend.sol

File: libs/MultiSendCallOnly.sol

48      function depositFor(address paymasterId) public 
55      function withdrawTo(address payable withdrawAddress, uint256 amount) public
```

### 7- `++i/i++` should be `unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as in the case when used in for & while loops :

There are 5 instances of this issue:
 
```
File: EntryPoint.sol

100     for (uint256 i = 0; i < opasLen; i++)
107     for (uint256 a = 0; a < opasLen; a++) 
112     for (uint256 i = 0; i < opslen; i++)
128     for (uint256 a = 0; a < opasLen; a++) 
134     for (uint256 i = 0; i < opslen; i++)
```
