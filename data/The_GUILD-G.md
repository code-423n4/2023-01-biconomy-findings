Redundant check

The if condition does a check that has been done with required statement before implementing it's code block. The required check was done and no changes was made to the handler which makes the if codition redundant.

      ```function init(address _owner, address _entryPointAddress, address _handler) public override initializer { 
        require(owner == address(0), "Already initialized");
        require(address(_entryPoint) == address(0), "Already initialized");
        require(_owner != address(0),"Invalid owner");
        require(_entryPointAddress != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
        require(_handler != address(0), "Invalid Entrypoint");
        owner = _owner;
        _entryPoint =  IEntryPoint(payable(_entryPointAddress));
        if (_handler != address(0)) internalSetFallbackHandler(_handler);
        setupModules(address(0), bytes(""));
    }```

The if condition can be removed to reduce gas consumption.
