# Use SafeMath or Math library to do the arithmetic operation
 Consider a example below, 
```
// calculating using  operators
max((_tx.targetTxGas * 64) / 63,_tx.targetTxGas + 2500) + 500

// calculating using SafeMath
max((_tx.targetTxGas.mul(64).div(63), _tx.targetTxGas.add(2500)).add(500)
```

The first expression uses parentheses and the `/` and `+` operators to perform arithmetic operations. This can be confusing to read and understand, especially if you are not familiar with the operator precedence rules in Solidity.

The second expression uses the `mul`, `div`, and `add` functions from the `SafeMath` library to perform the same arithmetic operations. This is generally considered to be a better practice, because it is easier to read and understand. It also automatically handles overflows and underflows, which can help to protect against  any potential bugs or vulnerabilities.

It's a good idea to use functions from the `SafeMath` library whenever you are performing arithmetic operations in your Solidity code. This can help make your code more readable, maintainable, and secure.
